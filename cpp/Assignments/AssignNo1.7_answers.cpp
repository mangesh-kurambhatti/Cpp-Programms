/*7) Imagine a tollbooth at a bridge. Cars passing by the booth are expected to pay a fifty-cent toll. Mostly they do, but sometimes a car goes by without paying.The tollbooth keeps track of the number of cars that have gone by and of the total amount of money collected.Model this tollbooth with a class called tollBooth.The two data items are a type unsigned int to hold the total number of cars, and a type double to hold the total amount of money collected.A constructor initializes all data members to 0.A member function called payingCar( ) increments the car total and adds 0.50 to the cash total.Another function, called NonPayingCar( ) increments the car total but adds nothing to the cash total.Finally, a function called print_record( ) displays the two totals and number of paying as well as non paying cars total. Include a progam to test this class.
